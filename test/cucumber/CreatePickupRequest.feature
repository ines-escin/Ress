#Feature: Create pickup request
#  As a residue generator properly logged on the system
#  I want to create a pickup request
#  So that the residue collectors can receive a notification to do the collection.
#
#
#  Scenario: Pickup request success.
#    Given there is no open pickup request for the residue generator with the username "testdummy"
#    When  I make a pickup request for my "50" liters residue container
#    Then  my pickup request should be stored in the database
#    And   the collector should be warned by email
#
#
#  Scenario: Pickup request fail
#    Given there is no open pickup request for the residue generator with the username "testdummy2"
#    When  I try to make a pickup request with the residue amount equals to "0"
#    Then  the system should not store the pickup request
#
#  @ignore
#  Scenario: Pickup request success interface
#    Given I am at the pickup request page
#    When  I fill the residue amount field with "60"
#    And   submit the value
#    Then  I should be taken to page with the pickup request information
#
#
#  @ignore
#  Scenario: Pickup request error interface
#    Given I am at the pickup request page
#    When  I let the residue amount field with a blank value
#    And   submit the form
#    Then  I should stay at the same page and see a validation error message
